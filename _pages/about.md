Deforestation is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. I am intrigued by how the dynamics of vegetation cover affect environmental quality. Moreover, what is the impact of disturbances (i.e., forest conversion, climate change, fire) on the ecosystem? To address these questions, I use an integration of remote sensing technologies and field measurements to describe these phenomena spatially and temporally.

Currently, I serve as a GIS and Forestry consultant with a focus on geospatial analyses, such as land-use change and deforestation mapping, and carbon stock modelling to ensure compliance for carbon credit projects under different carbon standards (i.e., Verra and Gold Standard). Additionally, I advise clients in evaluating nature-based credit projects, especially the technical components.
