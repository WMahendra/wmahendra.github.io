Deforestation are one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. It is intrigued, how do the dynamics of the vegetation cover affect the environmental quality? Moreover, what are the impact of disturbances (i.e. forest conversion, climate change, fire) on the ecosystem?. To address these questions, I use the integration between remote sensing technologies and field measurements to describe the phenomena spatially and temporally.
Currently, I serve my role as a GIS and Forestry consultant with a focus in geospatial analyses, such as land-use change, deforestation, and carbon stock modelling to ensure compliance for carbon credit projects under different carbon standards (i.e., Verra and Gold standard). Additionaly, I advice clients the evaluation the nature credit projects, especially the technical part.
